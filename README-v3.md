# üîñ v3.x.x

## üéØ Description

This version, building upon the v2.x.x deployment strategy, executes the `deploy-v2.mjs` file using the `npm run deploy:v2` command specified in the `package.json` file.

It does **not require the installation of additional NPM packages** specific to the deployment process, except for those already used in v2.x.x.
But note, that the new `deploy.yml` file uses `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-node` to make it work.

To use it, you'll need to **customize some data** in the `vue.config.js` and `deploy.yml` files, changing the `<USER_NAME>`, `<USER_EMAIL>` and `<REPO_NAME>` variables to match the username, the user email and repository name of your GitHub account.

The process still uses the script from the previous version, but incorporates **automatic deployment** via `GitHubActions`, which is a significant shift towards automation and CI/CD best practices.
When some changes are pushed to the `master` branch, the `deploy.yml` workflow is executed, which automatically performs certain steps to upload the changes to the `gh-pages` branch of a `git` repository uploaded to GitHub.

This process will **no longer be seen in the terminal** so you will have to go to the github website, search for your repository and watch each step to see if it finishes correctly.

In this configuration I will detail how `GithubActions` can be used to automate the `Deployment` process. But I will also describe how to configure the `Dependabot` file and the workflow for `Node`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

Begin by following the steps 0Ô∏è‚É£&nbsp;, 1Ô∏è‚É£&nbsp;, 2Ô∏è‚É£&nbsp;, 3Ô∏è‚É£&nbsp;, 4Ô∏è‚É£&nbsp; and 5Ô∏è‚É£&nbsp; outlined in the [README-v2.md](./README-v2.md) file.
This includes the installation of the required packages, the creation of the files and their configuration.

Then return to this version to follow the instructions below.
You should know that the following steps 1Ô∏è‚É£&nbsp; and 2Ô∏è‚É£&nbsp; are an extra to enhance your configuration, they are not required for the deployment.
