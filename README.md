# Deploy a Vue app to GitHub Pages

![Deploy Vue app](./README/images/vue-gh-pages.jpg)

> This repository has been created with the idea of serving as a tutorial to publish a public repository on the `github.io` domain using GitHub Pages.

**GitHub Pages** is a free service that provides a simple way to host your own website about yourself, your organization, or your project. It takes `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` files directly from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. It is therefore a static site hosting service and **does not support server-side code** such as `PHP`, `Ruby` or `Python`.

For more information, see:

-   "[About GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)": To learn about the different types of GitHub Pages sites.

-   "[Changing the visibility of your GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/changing-the-visibility-of-your-github-pages-site)": You can manage access control by publishing the site as public or private.

-   "[Using a custom domain with GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages)": You can host your site on GitHub's `github.io` domain or on your own custom domain.

-   "[Creating a GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)": To start, you need to **enable the service of GitHub Pages** in your Github repository.

# ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ . The `.gitignore` file

1.1. In the root of the project, there is a file called `.gitignore`, which was created when creating the [vue app](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/creating-a-project.html), if not create it with the next command:

```bash
touch .gitignore
```

1.2. It is important that the `.gitignore` file includes the `dist` folder, which will be created when building the project for production.

```bash
.DS_Store
node_modules
/dist
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ . The `vue.config.js` file

2.1. In the root of the project, there is also a `vue.config.js` file, if not create it with the next command:

```bash
touch vue.config.js
```

2.2. Inside of the `vue.config.js` file paste the next code:

```javascript
module.exports = {
	publicPath: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '/<REPO_NAME>/' : '/'
};
```

2.3. In the previous code, update the [`publicPath`](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/#publicpath) changing the `<REPO_NAME>` variable for the name of the repository where the application will be deployed.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ . The `deploy.sh` file

3.1. In the root of the project create the `deploy.sh` file:

```bash
touch deploy.sh
```

3.2. Inside of the `deploy.sh` file paste the next code:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh

# Abort on errors
set -e

# Build the files for production
npm run build

# Navigate into the build output directory
cd dist

# Inizialize git repository
git init

# Add all files to the repository
git add -A

# Commit the changes
git commit -m 'deploy'

# Push the new files to the remote repository if you are deploying to github.io
git push -f https://github.com/<USER_NAME>/<REPO_NAME>.git master:gh-pages

# Return to the previous directory
cd -
```

The `bash` script built in the `deploy.sh` file is executed at the root of the project, it contains the serial execution of the commands necessary for the project release:

1.  `#!/usr/bin/env sh`: Run the next `shell` script writted in the `bash` language.
2.  `set -e`: Abort the execution if there are errors.
3.  `npm run build`: Build the files for production, this creates the `dist` folder.
4.  `cd dist`: Navigate into the `dist` folder, the output directory.
5.  `git init`: Inizialize a new empty Git repository.
6.  `git add`: Add all folders and files to the `staging area` of the new git repository.
7.  `git commit`: Create the first commit with the changes and the `deploy` message in the `master` branch of this new repository.
8.  `git push`: Pushes the changes from the `master` branch of the new repository to the `gh-pages` branch, which is automatically created, if it does not exist, in our main repository.
9.  `cd -`: Return to the previous directory.

The name `GitHub Pages` originates from the name of the `gh-pages` branch, where the deployment version of the project is located.

3.3. Replace the word `<USER_NAME>` with your GitHub username and `<REPO_NAME>` with the name of your repository.

The **last git command** must be replaced with any the next commands:

-   If you are deploying to `https://<USER_NAME>.github.io/<REPO_NAME>`.

```bash
git push -f https://github.com/<USER_NAME>/<REPO_NAME>.git master:gh-pages
```

-   If you do have your GitHub account configured to connect via SSH.

```bash
git push -f git@github.com:<USER_NAME>/<REPO_NAME>.git master:gh-pages
```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ . The `package.json` file

4.1. Create the next npm script inside of `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
	"deploy": "chmod +x ./deploy.sh && ./deploy.sh"
}
```

The script executes 2 commands, one after the other:

1. `chmod +x deploy.sh`: Assign the execution permission in the root of the project.
2. `./deploy.sh`: Execute the `deploy.sh` file with `node`.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ . Deploy the application

5.1. Finally, you can deploy the application by running the `npm run deploy` command with the terminal while in the root of the project.

![Info of Vue deployment in the terminal](./README/images/deploy-v1.jpg)

5.2. To see the result, wait for the execution of the script to finish and open the application in the browser:

Use the next link replacing the `<USER_NAME>` and `<REPO_NAME>` variables with your data.

```
https://<USER_NAME>.github.io/<REPO_NAME>/
```

Here I leave you the example of mine:

### [https://beatrizsmerino.github.io/vue-gh-pages/](https://beatrizsmerino.github.io/vue-gh-pages/)

# üöÄ Project setup

## Install npm packages

```bash
npm install
```

## Create a Server for development (compiles and hot-reloads the code)

```bash
npm run serve
```

## Build the files for production (compile and minify the code)

```bash
npm run build
```

## Format the code (lints and fix bugs)

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Publish the code for production in GitHub Pages

```bash
npm run deploy
```
